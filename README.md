Project Name : Weather Station

This project implements an Embedded Weather Monitoring System using the STM32F4 microcontroller. The system efficiently reads and processes data from multiple sensors: a DHT22 for temperature and humidity, an LDR for light intensity, and a Rain Sensor. Data is displayed locally on an I2C LCD and transmitted serially via UART. The system uses a SysTick timer interrupt to trigger sensor readings every 3 seconds, ensuring periodic and synchronized data acquisition. Furthermore, a buzzer is integrated to provide an audible alert during heavy or light rain conditions, demonstrating real-time response capabilities based on environmental data.
